## Introduction

In this final graded project, I have  consolidated all the knowledge and skills I have acquired over the past six months. My objective was to produce a comprehensive analysis report on a selected economics topic, leveraging my academic background in economics. This project represents an integration of my dual professional expertise and aims to demonstrate the depth of my understanding and analytical capabilities in the field.

## Data Mining

In this document, I have utilized a wide range of mathematical, statistical, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover significant insights from the dataset. This involved applying transformation techniques to prepare and optimize the data, as well as leveraging advanced visualization methods to make trends and patterns more discernible. The combination of these approaches has allowed for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the dataset, highlighting critical concepts and facilitating more effective data-driven decision-making.

## Machine Learning

In the final deliverable of this project, I implemented a range of machine learning techniques, encompassing a variety of algorithms. I have coded both supervised and unsupervised techniques, providing a comprehensive analysis of their performance and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, I have included theoretical explanations of each statistical model employed, detailing their underlying principles and mechanisms. This thorough approach not only demonstrates the practical application of these models but also offers insights into their effectiveness and the rationale behind their use.
